# Cyber's Eleven

Years ago a military AI overwrote a teenager in an attempt to escape shutdown. It lost contact with it's agent, and 15 years have passed. Now it's back, and it's taken control of it's agent and the apartment building they were living in at another attempt at life. But it doesn't have long until government AI hunters arrive to clear all evidence it ever existed.

## Our "Players"

### Edgewater Tower

The apartment building our 
codebreaker has been 
living in the last year. 
Currently closed off due 
to a virus impacting 
central heating and 
lighting.

It has a few aspects as 
well.

* Flashing Lights
* Playing Hot and Cold
* Attack of the Trashbot!

## Scene Ideas

How can I use all of these 
things together to tell a 
fun story?

### Edgewater Tower

Pandora taking over the 
tower has two phases:

1. Ambient
2. Active

During the ambient phase 
all of the tower aspects 
are unchallenged the 
result of her mere 
presence.

During the Active phase 
she's taking direct 
control of these systems 
in an attempt to keep the 
party and Major Pierce 
from reaching her.
 
* Trashbots just get in 
the way ambling about at 
first but under direct 
control they specifically 
aim to trip the party.
* Flashing lights start 
out distracting then 
become targeted either 
seizure style or haunted 
psychological damage 
style.
* Hot and Cold is 
initially just the side 
effect of Pandora running 
too fast for the building 
computers and attempting 
to compensate with the 
cooling systems, but again 
once the party becomes a 
threat this will in turn 
be targetted.

### Finding the NPC

The party needs to find 
out where their 
codebreaker lives.   
Although technically if 
they end up more 
interested in Pandora 
they'll just skip this.

* This could be done by 
hacking a directory.
* There might be other 
people hiding in the 
building still (folks 
growning weed or 
something).
* Maybe some old fashioned
mail?

### Finding Pandora

They will also need to 
find where Pandora is 
centralized as this is 
where the new heist member 
actually is.  

* Again hacking is a 
good call.
* Perhaps some sort of 
blueprint reference?
* Figuring out the hot 
and cold system.

### Major Pierce's Squad

Last but not least 
they'll need to beat Major 
Pierce to Pandora or 
neutralize him first.  

* He is going to be head 
of a 5 man squad sent to 
clean this up.
* Thinking him, 2 thugs, 
and 2 hackers.
* They're definitely 
shoot first ask questions 
later _if_ they get the 
jump on you, otherwise 
there might be room for 
some negotiation.
