# Steph's Main Skyrim Mods

Here is a list of the mods that I use to make for a more engaging Skyrim experience. I have a few primary goals with these mods.

1. Bugfixes (bethesda isn't great about ongoing bugfixes, also a lot of mods end up relying on the community patches as time goes on)
2. Immersion  
  * Systems immersion, such as cold weather exposure, bodily needs, difficulty setting scaling
  * Technical immersion, such as lighting adjustments
  * World immersion, such as disabling level scaling, providing better quest descriptions, and generally making the world feel more alive and less gamie.

## Tools to grab

The following is a list tools and sites I use to manage my mods:

* [**Vortex Mod Manager**](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/)  
  > The official client for Nexus Mods and very full featured.
* [**Wrye Bash**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1840)  
  > A mod management and installation utility used by some of the mods later in the list.

## Bugfixes

* [**Unofficial Skyrim Legendary Edition Patch**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71214)  
  > Fixes a bunch of stuff Bethesda never got around to

## System Immersion

* [**Difficulty for Everyone**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=20892)  
  > Changes damage modifiers the same amount in both ways, instead of making you do less damage while enemies do more. Basically makes combat a lot more fatal in both directions as difficulty scales.
* [**Frostfall**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11163)  
  > Frostfall is a survival-style mod that adds cold weather survival gameplay elements to Skyrim.
* [**Imps More Complex Needs**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10639)  
  > A highly detailed hunger/thirst/sleep/alcohol/fatigue/etc. mod developed with realism in mind. Originally released for Fallout 3 and New Vegas.

## Technical Immersion

* [**Darker Nights**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/88476)  
  > This mod simply makes the nights in skyrim darker.
* [**Brighter Torches with Bigger Radius**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32156)  
  > Boosts the brightness of Torches by 50% and the radius of torches by 100%
* [**Real Wildlife**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9778)  
  > Adds a ton of more immersive wildlife to the game, herds of horses are one of my favorites, tiny rats running around towns are cute too!

## World Immersion

* [**Live Another Life**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9557)  
  > Gives a variety of starting places to chose from. The shipwreck is EXTRA fun with Frostfall installed
* [**Better Quest Objectives - EBQO**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32695)  
  > Provides quest objectives you can actually follow by reading instead of having to rely on the magic compass marker throughout the game
* [**Skyrim Scaling Stopper**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9857)  
  > This mod is a leveled list overhaul to make it so weapons and armor of higher quality than steel are rare, treasure is not leveled, and most enemies aren't leveled.
* [**Duel - Combat Realism**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2700/)  
  > Well known combat mod that enhance enemies A.I., implement a new stagger system based on fight context (armor types, weapon types, health, stamina, ...), enhance stealth, enhance archery, enhance blocking with a shield or weapon, enhance group A.I. and a couple of other useful tweaks that will add to the fights.
* [**Shenk Thievery Overhaul**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10336)  
  > This mod aims to make thievery in Skyrim more rewarding, as well as a bit more challenging. Added stealthy ways of getting around the five major cities, vaults, NPC guards, other thieves.
